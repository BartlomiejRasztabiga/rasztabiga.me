### Week 10 update

In the last week, I've been able to close all of my tasks. We've also found 3 more endpoints that I forgot to implement, so they were my main goal for this week.


#### Issues closed.

There were 5 issues closed this week:

* [RESTWS-833](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-833)
* [RESTWS-835](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-835)
* [RESTWS-845](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-845)
* [RESTWS-846](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-846)
* [RESTWS-847](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-847)

#### Next week

That's it. These were all my tasks for GSoC 2021 :)

In the upcoming week, I'm going to work on my final evaluation. I will have to create a video presentation about my project and a document describing all my tasks.

Best regards and see you next week!
