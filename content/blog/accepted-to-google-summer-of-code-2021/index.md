### As the title says

I've been accepted to participate in Google Summer of Code 2021 in the OpenMRS organization!

### Choosing organization

As I've already contributed to OpenMRS in Google Code-in 2017 that was a natural move to choose the same organization
for GSoC :)

### My project

In GSoC 2021, I’m working on the project The REST of Administration. This project aims to provide REST endpoints for
administrative functions that are not yet available through REST. That’s a requirement for proceeding with developing
new Microfrontend Architecture. One of the goals of this project is to be able to render links to administration pages
for install modules within a new (REACT-based) administration application.

Project on GSoC dashboard: [](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6176312789565440)

You can read my proposal
here: [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Z3ui0y7h8gapoSuIiEJJ6jsK2RImSJCUyKfvb4LWcc/edit?usp=sharing)

### My first task

My first major objective is to find missing endpoint from administrative functions.

I will start by adding the support to be able to export links of administration pages through REST resource.

### What's next?

I will be posting on a weekly basis about my GSoC experiences, so feel free to stick around!
