### Week 7 update

#### Issues closed.

The were no issues closed this week. It's because 4 of them are currently pending Code Review, and the whole OpenMRS community mourns over the loss of our friend, Joseph Kaweesi.

#### PRs in Code Review

There are also 4 tasks currently undergoing a code review by my mentors:

* [RESTWS-829](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-829)
* [RESTWS-836](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-836)
* [RESTWS-828](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-828)
* [RESTWS-830](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-830)

#### In progress tasks

There are also 2 tasks currently in progress:

* [RESTWS-831](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-832)
* [RESTWS-832](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-832)

#### Next week

In the upcoming week, I'm going to work on the two issues above. Both of them will involve creating new REST resources, as well as adding some documentation to them.

Best regards and see you next week!
