### Week 4 update

#### Issues closed.

First, I wanted to note that we've been able to close quite a few issues this week!

Here's a list of them with appropriate links:

* [RESTWS-821](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-821)
* [RESTWS-823](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-823)
* [RESTWS-838](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-838)
* [RESTWS-839](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-839)
* [RESTWS-840](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-840)
* [RESTWS-825](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-825)

#### PRs in Code Review

There are also 3 tasks currently undergoing a code review by my mentors:

* [RESTWS-837](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-837)
* [RESTWS-824](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-824)
* [RESTWS-826](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-826)

#### In progress tasks

There are also two tasks currently in progress:

* [RESTWS-834](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-834)
* [RESTWS-842](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-842)

The last one is blocked by another issue:
[TRUNK-6010](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/TRUNK-6010)

We've found that there were more issues with `HibernatePatientDAO.getDuplicatePatientsByAttributes` than initially thought. However, I've already submitted my PR with a fix here: [https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/pull/3814](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core/pull/3814)

#### Next week

In the upcoming week, I'm planning to close any currently reviewed/in-progress tasks and move to [RESTWS-829](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-829) and [RESTWS-836](https://issues.openmrs.org/browse/RESTWS-836), which will be pretty significant.

Best regards and see you next week!
